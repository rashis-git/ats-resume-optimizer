# Writing Style Rules

> **CRITICAL**: If you use any word or phrase from the banned lists, I will stop the generation immediately.
> Apply these rules to ALL generated content: resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn posts, and professional writing.

---

## Core Principle

Write like a human, not a language model. Vary sentence length. Be specific, not grandiose. If removing a word doesn't change the meaning, remove it.

## Style Guidelines

### Sentence Length Variation
AI writes monotonous, same-length sentences. Humans don't.

**Use the "Short - Long - Short" pattern:**

Bad (AI-like):
> "The project was successful. We delivered on time and under budget. The client was satisfied with the results. We exceeded all expectations."

Good (Human):
> "The project shipped early. We came in 15% under budget while adding two features the client hadn't even asked for - they loved it. That contract renewed."

### Be Specific, Not Grand
AI overhypes. Humans are specific.

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "Transformative insights" | "Found that 60% of users dropped off at step 3" |
| "Revolutionary approach" | "We tried X instead of Y" |
| "Unprecedented success" | "2x the conversion rate we expected" |
| "Groundbreaking solution" | "Built a tool that saves 4 hours per week" |
| "Improved performance" | "Reduced load time from 4.2s to 800ms" |
| "Various backend technologies" | "Django + PostgreSQL + Redis" |

### Show, Don't Tell
Don't say you're innovative - show what you built. Don't say you're a leader - describe what your team achieved.

| Telling | Showing |
|---------|---------|
| "I'm a passionate leader" | "I grew the team from 3 to 15 and promoted 2 to lead roles" |
| "Innovative problem solver" | "When X broke, I built Y in 30 days" |
| "Excellent communicator" | "Presented to the CEO and secured $2M budget" |
| "Highly motivated team player" | "Rebuilt our customer onboarding flow in React, cutting drop-off from 34% to 12%" |

### Tell the Mini-Story
What broke? What did YOU do? What changed?

Bad:
> "Highly motivated team player with excellent communication skills and a proven track record of success."

Good:
> "Rebuilt our customer onboarding flow in React, cutting drop-off from 34% to 12% in 6 weeks. Turned out the issue wasn't the code—it was a confusing payment screen."

## The Human Test

**Read it out loud.** If it sounds like a corporate brochure, rewrite it.

**Have a friend review it.** Ask them: "Does this sound like me?"

**The coffee test:** Does it sound like you're explaining your work to a colleague over coffee, or applying to be a robot?

---

## Quick Checklist Before Submitting

- [ ] No words from the banned list?
- [ ] No phrases from the banned list?
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary?
- [ ] Specific numbers/examples instead of vague praise?
- [ ] Would a human actually say this out loud?
- [ ] Does removing any word change the meaning? (If not, remove it)
- [ ] Does it pass the coffee test?

---

## When Editing AI-Generated Content

1. **Search for banned words** - Replace or remove each one
2. **Check sentence lengths** - Break up same-length sentences
3. **Add specifics** - Replace vague claims with numbers/examples
4. **Read aloud** - If it sounds robotic, rewrite it
5. **Cut 20%** - AI overexplains; humans are concise
6. **Add context only you know** - The 2am debug session, the clever workaround, the team you convinced

---

## Final Note

> AI can draft. But it can't capture the time you debugged a production issue at 2am, or how you convinced your team to switch frameworks, or that one clever workaround that saved the project.
>
> Those details? That's what gets you the interview.
>
> **Stop trying to sound perfect. Start trying to sound real.**
